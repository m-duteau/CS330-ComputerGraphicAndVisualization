# CS330-ComputerGraphicAndVisualization
A rendered 3D scene using OpenGL.
texture[#].zip .pngs need to be extracted to Final_Project/textures in order for Source.cpp to find them!

# How do I approach designing software?
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I've no experience with OpenGL or 3D development prior to this course. After taking this course, I've gained a great deal of understand of how to create shapes using vertex and index manipulation as well as using various transformations in order for 3D elements to be properly placed within the environment. This is a good basis for future applications in game development or UI design.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process mainly revolved around assuring that the project had a function for each required mesh shape, e.g., sphere, pyramid, cube, etc. This was then taken further to create functions that construct each 3D object, using the mesh building functions in tandem with transformations in order to properly replicate each required object.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
With the intension of going into the software engineering field, the use of headers to allocate functions that produce similar results in order to keep the project organized will be integral in future applications, to keep code concise and easy to understand.

# How do I approach developing programs?
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
As mentioned, with no prior experience in 3D development, much of the strategies I learned were completely new to me, aside from the use of Visual Studio. That being said, everything I've learned, from mesh building to applying textures to creating light sources, were applied in order to work on this scene.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Most iteration is based within the main method, which implements the render loop that controls the frames and input processing. Beyond this, I feel more iteration could have been applied overall, especially when considering mesh/texture creation and destruction.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
The milestone assignments were a great way of introducing new topics regarding OpenGL each week, making it easier to absorb and apply these methods to the final project. The evolution mainly revolved around the journey from "How to I create this shape?" to "How do I apply different shape meshes and textures in a way that creates a convincing replication of a real life object?"

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
On top of having gained some surface level experience in graphic design using OpenGL, I feel the course has reinforced that notion that my capabilities are not limited to what I already know. After diving head first into completely new territory by taking this course, I am happy to say that the result of this project exceeded my expectations despite my prior lack of knowledge on the subject matter.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
As someone pursuing software engineering professionally, the utilization of rendering graphics, whether 2D or 3D, is bound to be invaluable within my field. On top of learning elements of a new language, such as OpenGL, I've also built a foundation for considerations in UI development.
